        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>
            I'm an aspiring web developer with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I enjoy
            running, playing video games, and skiing in my free time. I have one cat named "Emmy," 
            and she has an insatiable need for attention.

            In November of 2018 I had the opportunity to invest in and help open a Sushi Omakase restaurant in the
            SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. It was just me and the chef working there for the first 
            three months. It was a lot of work, but we established it to a point that we could hire staff
            to operate the restaurant for us! Now I help out behind the scenes by maintaining our website.
